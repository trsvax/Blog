<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I've been thinking about how to integrate the loop with the pagination control. I'd like them to to remain independent
but allow them to work together. In Tapestry components are somewhat isolated from each other however there is a way
to share data across a group of components called Environmental Services.
</p>
<p>
So the idea is to create environments for each component and control all of them with a common class. That class could
be a component but I'm going to use a mixin instead. This way each component just renders the interface. All the controlling
logic is in the mixin. Hopefully this will allow plugging the pieces together in various ways. 
</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
I'm taking a different approach to the requirements this time. I've created a sample template I'd like to implement.
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;t:any t:mixins="tb/pager" source="items"&gt;
    &lt;t:tb.pagination/&gt;
        &lt;t:tb.mediagrid row="item"&gt;
        &lt;a href="#123"&gt;
            &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="${url}"/&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;${item.mediaTitle}&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;button class="btn"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/t:tb.mediagrid&gt;     
    &lt;t:tb.pagination/&gt;
&lt;/t:any&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The idea is the pager mixin is the controller and components inside the 'any' component may be under it's control. 
I can put as many pagination controls inside the 'any' component as I like and they just work. I can even mix
different kinds as long as they obey the rules.
</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
The first step is to control the components via the environment instead of input parameters. After some experimenting
I decided simple is better and I changed my input parameters to this.
<pre>
@Property
@Environmental
private PaginationEnvironment values;

@Parameter(value="values.currentPage",required=true)
private Integer currentPage; 
</pre>
I can still pass values via parameters but the default values now come from the environment. PaginationEnviroment is an
interface so it's possible to interchange various implementations of environment and components. The next step is getting
the objects into the environment. To do this I need a pager mixin. As an experiment I created this:
<pre>
@Parameter(required=true)
private List<T> source;
		
@SetupRender
void setupRender()  {
	Integer currentPage = valueEncoderSource.getValueEncoder(Integer.class).toValue(request.getParameter("gallery"));
				
	LoopValues<T> loopSupport = new LoopValues<T>();
   	loopSupport.setSource( source.subList(5, 7) );
   	
   	PaginationValues paginationValues = new PaginationValues();
   	paginationValues.setCurrentPage(currentPage);
   	paginationValues.setItemCount(source.size());
   	
	environment.push(LoopEnvironment.class, loopSupport);
	environment.push(PaginationEnvironment.class, paginationValues);
}
</pre>
For now this just creates the environment and makes it available to the contained components. There is also an
afterRender to clean things up. A side effect of this is it solved my @ActivationRequestParameter problem. 
Now that logic is contained in the mixin so the problem does no spill into my other code. Each part now has
it's job to do. The mixin figures out what part of the list needs to be displayed by the loop. It also 
passes the right values to the pagination component so it can display the right thing. Each of the sub components
now just display their part. The loop does not know it's only displaying a subset of the data and the pagination
component does not know there is a loop. The pager mixin does not care how many pagination components there are
or how they work.
</p>
<p>
It took a bit of experimenting to come up with this plan. At first I went off and created a new set of
annotations to handle putting the environment into the parameters. After a few failed attempts it 
occurred to me the functionality was already there. One problem/feature with this approach is things outside
the 'any' tag have no access to the inner workings. I think I'm also going to create some events so that
the containers can have some say in how things work.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Now that I have things prototyped I'm happy with the results and I'm going to create some real components. It appears
this approach will allow the various parts to cooperate without knowing about each other. It also allows
things to just work in the simple case but provides a lot of customization if needed.
</p>
<h3>Feature Request</h3>
<p>
It would be nice if all components could use the environment for defaults. To do this add environment to the
@Parameter annotation:
<pre>
@Parameter(environment=com.trsvax.PaginationEnvironment.class,required=true)
private Integer currentPage;
</pre>
This would get the environment and look for a getCurrentPage method. Next just push defaults into the 
environment with a AppModule. Lastly an environmentPush mixin to override the defaults.
 There may be some overlap with MetaData here. I need to read more about it.
