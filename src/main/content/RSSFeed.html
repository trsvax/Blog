<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
I've gotten several requests for an RSS feed to this Blog. I could find some free one but I decided to write one.
</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add RSS to Blog</li>
<li>Leave open the possibility for Atom</li>
</ol>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
I'm going to use JAXB to generate the XML and then the standard Java XML library to 
transform it into RSS format. This decouples the output formats
from my internal java objects and JAXB is about as easy as it gets. There is not a lot of Tapestry here just the
StreamResponse to return the XML. First the JAXB class:
<pre class="prettyprint">
@XmlRootElement
public class Blogs {
	private List<Blog> blogs;
	
	public Blogs() {		
	}
	
	public Blogs(List<Blog> blogs) {
		this.blogs = blogs;
	}

	
	@XmlElement(name="blog",type=BlogImpl.class)
	public List<Blog> getBlogs() {
		return blogs;
	}
		
}
</pre>
The only trick here it the type in XmlElement. Since Blog is an interface I have to tell JAXB what the real
class is.
<p>
Next comes the
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/Blog/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/services/XMLImpl.java">XML service</a>.
This does three things. First it uses JAXB to convert the object to XML. Next it uses 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/Blog/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/xslt/rss.xslt">XSLT</a> 
to transform that XML
into the correct format and finally it converts that XML to a StreamResponse.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Pretty easy and I now have a general purpose XML converter. To create the ATOM format I just need to write some xslt.
I also use the same technique to create PDFs by using FOP. Someday I'll add a streamPDF method.
