<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Now that I have a proof of concept Media Grid it's time to build a 
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> 
module. While it's possible to use 
Tapestry and Bootstrap together by just using the css I think it's easier to code &ltlabel/&gt; instead of trying
to remember all the css rules. I also like to use Enums in the java code instead of strings. I'm going to use
the jQuery module because I prefer jQuery and Bootstrap also uses jQuery.
</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Include the Bootstrap css and javascript in the classpath</li>
<li>Build widget mixins for the Bootstrap javascript</li>
<li>Integrate media grid with pagination</li>
<li>Allow media grid to progressive load as the user scrolls</li>
<li>Build component wrappers for various Bootstrap items such as alerts</li>
<li>Integrate the Tapestry alerts with the Bootstrap alerts</li>
<li>Allow the various components to use the environment for parameter defaults</li>
<li>Build a mixin that can push objects into the environment</li>
</ol>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
There is a lot going on here but most is just typing. The first step is to create all the Interfaces and Enums
needed by the components and then implement the interfaces. I decided to put all this in an environment 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/tree/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/environment">package</a>.
The interfaces contain the setable input parameters for the components. The Enums are just the values that can be set.
For example AlertType could be info, warning or error. The implementations are just beans.
</p>
<p>
The components are slightly more interesting. For example the 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/components/BasicAlert.java">BasicAlert</a> 
component contains:
<pre class="prettyprint">
	@Parameter(value="prop:alert?.type",defaultPrefix="literal")
	private String type;
	
	@SuppressWarnings("unused")
	@Environmental(false)
	@Property
	private AlertEnvironment alert;
</pre>
This finds an environment (if there is one) that implements the AlertEnvironment interface. The parameter default
uses that environment if it's not null to set the type string. I also made the default prefix "literal". This
allows the values to be set as strings in the tml but as Enums in java. Tapestry magically does all the conversion.
Most of the components are just variations of the same.
</p>
<p>
The media grid component is built from various parts. First I needed a loop but I wanted to be able to set
the source via the environment so I built a 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/components/Loop.java">wrapper</a>
for the Tapestry loop. Next I built the 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/components/Pagination.java">pagination</a>
 component. It's just the one covered before but able to recieve is parameters via the environment. This also solved
 my ActivationRequestParameter dilemma. Now the paginator just gets the current page from the environment. Then
 there is the 
 <a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/mixins/InfiniteScroll.java"> InfiniteScroll mixin</a>
 thanks to <a href="http://infinite-scroll.com/">Paul Irish & Luke Shumard</a>. This allows the grid to refresh as
 the users scrolls. Finally and perhaps most important is the
 <a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/mixins/Pager.java">pager mixin</a>.
 This acts as the controler for the whole thing by pushing input parameters to the various pieces via the environment.
 Here is the MediaGrip template:
 <pre class="prettyprint">
 &lt;t:any t:id="mediaGrid" t:mixins="tb/pager" source="source" parameterName="parameterName" &gt;
      &lt;ul t:type="any" t:id="gridContent" class="media-grid gallery" t:mixins="tb/infiniteScroll"
      	options='{navSelector: ".pagination", nextSelector: "a#next:last", itemSelector: "#gridContent li"}'&gt;
	      &lt;t:tb.loop t:id="loop"&gt;
	      	&lt;li&gt;&lt;t:body/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	      &lt;/t:tb.loop&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;     
      &lt;t:tb.pagination/&gt;
&lt;/t:any&gt;
 </pre>
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/components/MediaGrid.java">MediaGrid.java</a>
is less interesting because it contains no code just declarations.
</p>
<p>
Finally there is the 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/mixins/PushEnvironment.java">PushEnvironment mixin</a>.
This mixin just pushes objects into the environment. Since this requires an interface I created an
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/environment/Environment.java">Environment annotation</a>
to that includes the interface with the implementation. I tried a few other ways to decided this was the most reliable.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I think this module is a good example of how little code it takes to create a useful set of components. According to wc
there are about 3500 lines of code. Most of it is really boilerplate and generated by Eclipse. After I really got started it took about 2 days working part time to put the
module together.
</p>
<p>
The new ground here is defaulting parameters via the environment and using a mixin to control a set of components.
Using the environment to set defaults allows fine grain control over a set of components. By combining this with a
mixin it's possible to create a super component built from a set of loosely connected sub components with all the
logic in the mixin. Since each part is pluggable the developer has complete control over the parts.
