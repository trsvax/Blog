<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Turns out my Pagination solution was not as clever as I thought. The ActivationRequestParameter only works in pages and
I need it to work in a component. Fortunately Tapestry provides a solution to these kinds of problems. In most cases you
can change/override the behavior of the framework without modifying the framework code directly.
</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make ActivationRequestParameter do what I want</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Tapestry works by transforming your pages/component classes into something that handles all the ugly parts of web
development for you. In this case I want a request parameter to populate a field in my component. While that's easy
enough I don't want to write the code every time I do it because like most things it's never and simple as it seems.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately in my case this annotation uses the onActivate event to populate the fields. That's great except
components don't have an onActivate. By design Tapestry allows me to provide my own code code generation methods.
The plan is to use a setupRender method instead of onActivate to accomplish the same thing. To do this create
a <a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/services/ComponentRequestParameterWorker.java">ComponentClassTransformWorker2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since I wanted the same basic functionality of ActivationRequestParameterWorker I started with that and just changed
how the event handling works. First I find all the annotated fields. If there are some I add a setupRender method.
Then I advise that method to set the values and finally invoke the real method. I've got some more cleanup but this
is enough to convince me the pagination component will work.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Class rewriting is what makes the magic of Tapestry happen. The good news is like most magic it's obvious once you
know the trick.
