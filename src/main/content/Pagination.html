<h3>Overview</h3>
I'm happy with the Twitter Bootstrap templates I used on the Blog project and I think I'll be using them again
so it's time to create a library. I know I'm going to need pagination in my next project so let's start there.
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Support the bootstramp pageination css</li>
<li>Pages can be bookmarked</li>
<li>The component should be stand alone</li>
<li>Page control by event or URL parameter</li>
</ol>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
I just use Maven to create a Tapestry project and then delete the stuff I don't need for a library. In this case that's webapp and pages.
Also change the name of AppModule.java and the pom target to jar.
</p>
<p>
For now I'm just going to create a pagination component.
There is not much markup needed and a lot of flow control so I'm just putting everything in
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/components/Pagination.java">Pagination.java</a>.
The only real trick to this is using the ActivationRequestParameter annotation from the currentPage parameter to drive the link type.
The container can specify this by just declaring
<code>
<pre>
    @Property
    @ActivationRequestParameter("pagination")
    private Integer currentPage;
</pre>
</code>
and
<code>
<pre>
&lt;t:tb.pagination itemCount="literal:16" currentPage="currentPage"/&gt;
</pre>
</code>
in the template. The component will pick up the annotation from currentPage and use that to add a url parameter to the links.
If no annotation is provided the component will use events to move from page to page.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I like to just start with a library when I think I might share code between projects. They are easy to create and github makes
them easy to share. There is more to be done here and I'll revisit this library soon, but this is what I need to build the
next piece, a gallery component.
