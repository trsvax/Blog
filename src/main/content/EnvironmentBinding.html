<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
After using parameters set via the environment for a few days I'm finding the property syntax a bit painful
and error prone. The compiler can't help because everything is wrapped up in a string. I'd like to just
say
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Parameter(value=AlertEnvironment.type,defaultPrefix="literal")
private String type;
</pre>
and be done with it.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
Create an environment binding that connects component parameters to the environment.
</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
Bindings require two classes a factory and the class that does the work. The idea is you take a string 
"env:com.trsvax.bootstrap.environment.AlertEnvironment.type" and use the part before the ":" to determine
the factory. Then factory builds an object for the following expression.
</p>
<p>
For this binding the expression will be the class name of the environment interface followed by a property expression.
I built a prototype just using reflection but Tapestry is all about speed so I looked up the source for PropBindingFactory
 started from there and created 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/services/EnvironmentBindingFactory.java">EnvironmentBindingFactory</a>. 
The basic idea is you create a conduit to the method in the target object. From there some magic
plastic stuff happens.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Integer index = expression.lastIndexOf(".");
String className = expression.substring(0, index);
String propertyExpression = expression.substring(index+1);
Class enviromentInterface = Class.forName(className);
PropertyConduit conduit = source.create(enviromentInterface, propertyExpression);
	
//StringInterner is internal
String toString = String.format("EnvironmentBinding[%s %s(%s)]", description, container.getCompleteId(), expression);
return new EnvironmentBinding(location,conduit,toString,environment,enviromentInterface);
</pre> 
<p>
First the expression is split into the class name and the property expression. Both of these are passed
to the conduit service and out comes a PropertyConduit. Since I'm using a PropertyConduit the property
expression can be more than a property name. The conduit uses the same grammer as the prop binding.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to create
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/services/EnvironmentBinding.java">EnvironmentBinding</a>.
This just implements Binding creating the get/set methods. I also set isInvariant to false. This means
the get method result will not be cached. 
</p>
<p>
To use the new binding I created some static strings in the environment interfaces.
<pre class="prettyprint">
public interface AlertEnvironment {
	public final static String type = "env:com.trsvax.bootstrap.environment.AlertEnvironment.type";
	public AlertType getType();
}
</pre>
so now the component parameters are just
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Parameter(value=AlertEnvironment.type,defaultPrefix="literal")
private String type;
</pre>
and there is no need for an environment property in the component.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Binding prefixes are powerful and easy to implement. Unfortunately they are just strings so the compiler
can't ensure they are correct but making then static strings means you can find them and have one place
in the code to control them.
