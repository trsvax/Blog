	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>I do a lot of woodworking and one thing I've learned over the
		years, "You have to use jigs". Sometimes you can buy them but most of
		the time you just make them from a few scraps laying around. They
		don't need to be pretty and many times you just throw them away after
		a project. Some of them stick around and I have a shelf full of
		strange/ugly really useful ones.</p>
	<p>So what does this have to do with web development? Web sites are
		built from individual pages that need to fit together. If everything
		is not quit right then no amount of finish work will fix it. So I
		build jigs to create pages and components. In the old days that meant
		creating a base class and making all your pages inherit from that. Seems
		like a good idea but before long the base class is thousands of lines
		of unrelated code. It's like a super tool that tries to do everything
		but ends up doing nothing well.</p>
	<p>So the problem at hand is I've used the activation context to pass state
		around. That was fine to start with but it's a bit limiting so I
		decided to switch to session state. Unfortunately now I must find all
		the pages that do this, remove the activation context, add session
		state then create a setup render method to initialize it. After the
		second page I was thinking there has to be a better way.</p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>Create a way to declare the value for a property so I can do
		this:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
@Property
@Connect(Globals.ORGANIZATION)
private Organization organization;
</pre>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Implementation</h2>
	<p>Parameters already have this feature so I'll start from there.
		It's the binding expression that makes this really powerful. In ths
		case I'm going to use the expression
		"session:com.trsvax.web.State.currentOrganization". This expression
		will lookup the session state com.trsvax.web.State then connect the
		property to the currentOrganizaion property. To do this I'm going to
		need a few parts.</p>
	<p>
		First I need a binding that can get things from the session. I have
		one that gets things from the environment and this is pretty much the
		same thing. A binding is made from by a factory.
		In this case the <a
			href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/services/SessionBindingFactory.java">SessionBindingFactory</a>
		handles that task:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
try {
Integer index = expression.lastIndexOf(".");
String className = expression.substring(0, index);
String propertyExpression = expression.substring(index+1);
Class stateClass = Class.forName(className);
PropertyConduit conduit = source.create(stateClass, propertyExpression);
	
//StringInterner is internal
String toString = String.format("SessionBinding[%s %s(%s)]", description, 
    container.getCompleteId(), expression);
return new SessionBinding(location,conduit,toString,state,stateClass);
}  catch (Exception ex) {
    throw new TapestryException(ex.getMessage(), location, ex);
}
</pre>
	<p>
		Since this is a jig I'm not going to get hung up on error handling.
		I'm going to assume the input is correct and if something goes wrong
		just throw an exception. Remember the expression must be final
		static so if it works in dev it should be OK. If things go right I end
		up with a binding to a property expression in my session state. The <a
			href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/services/SessionBinding.java">SessionBinding</a>
		class implements Binding and mostly just handles the get/set
		operations.
	</p>
	<p>Next I need a way to connect the binding with the property.
		First I'm going to mark the property with an annotation.</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Connect {

	public String value();

}
</pre>
	<p>Note: Always (and I mean ALWAYS) have
		@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME). I've spent many hours trying to
		figure out why my worker was not being called because of this. To me
		this is the perfect example of a broken default. The 5 compiler
		writers in the world thought RetentionPolicy.SOURCE was correct because that's what
		they needed but the rest of us would rather have
		RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME.</p>
	<p>
		Next it's time to pull everything together with the <a
			href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/bootstrap/services/ConnectWorker.java">ConnectWorker</a>.
		This is where plastic comes in. I'm going to find the properties
		marked by Connect annotation then create a conduit to the binding
		expression described by the annotation. While this sounds complicated
		thanks to plastic it does not require much code. The two interesting
		parts are finding the properties
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
for ( PlasticField field : plasticClass.getFieldsWithAnnotation(Connect.class) ) {
			transformField(field);
}
</pre>
	<p>and creating the binding.</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
Binding binding = bindingSource.newBinding(toString, resources, "prop", expression);
</pre>
	<p>Finally add the parts into the AppModule.</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
public static void bind(ServiceBinder binder) {
	binder.bind(BindingFactory.class,SessionBindingFactory.class).withId("SessionBindingFactory");
	binder.bind(BindingFactory.class,EnvironmentBindingFactory.class).withId("EnvironmentBindingFactory");
}
    
public static void contributeBindingSource(MappedConfiguration<String
			, BindingFactory> configuration,
		@InjectService("SessionBindingFactory") BindingFactory sessionBindingFactory,
		@InjectService("EnvironmentBindingFactory") BindingFactory environmentBindingFactory
		) {
    configuration.add("session", sessionBindingFactory);  
    configuration.add("env", environmentBindingFactory);
}

@Contribute(ComponentClassTransformWorker2.class)   
public static void  provideWorkers(OrderedConfiguration<ComponentClassTransformWorker2> workers) {    
    workers.addInstance("ConnectWorker", ConnectWorker.class);
} 
</ComponentClassTransformWorker2></String>
	</pre>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>I could have taken the easy way out and just fixed all my code,
		but is that really the easy way? First I had a lot of pages and I
		suspect this is actually less lines of code. Secondly if/when I change
		my mind again I just need to change the property expression defined by
		Globals.ORGANIZATION. Since I've used a binding expression I can
		create a new binding if needed. For example if I decide using the
		context really was better I could use "context:$1" meaning pull the
		first value from the context part of the url. In fact what I really
		think will happen is make URLs like /OrgName/users where OrgName is
		what I had in context before. To do this I'll create a binding like
		"url:$1" and make it work. Lastly since I've solved the problem by combining
		smaller jigs I can use them independently as above by creating
		different bindings for @Connect or using the session binding any place
		a binding express may be used. For example in my .tml I can use
		${session:name} to pull a persons name from the session.</p>
	<p>So when I find myself writing the same code over and over across
		multiple pages I know it's time to create a jig and use plastic
		to hold them together.</p>
