<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
I'm about to do some major upgrades to my wife's website <a href="http://judypaul.com">JudyPaul.com</a> 
and I've decided document them as well as open up some of the code. I could use some random blog software
but instead I decided to start out by creating a blog written with Tapestry 5.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
The first step is to create some requirements. The big picture is keep it simple and don't get bogged down.
Now that those are out of the way here are the more technical ones.

<dl>
<dt>Use Amazon S3 to store the data.</dt>
<dd>The data store requirements will be simple and S3 is zero maintenance</dd>
<dt>Use Tynamo Security</dt>
<dd>While it's way more than I need it's way faster than writing something.</dd>
<dt>Use HTML for markup</dt>
<dd>No work and I know HTML.</dd>
<dt>Use Twitter Bootstrap Template</dt>
<dd>This is an experiment. The templates look nice and appear to be easy to use.</dd>
</dl>
