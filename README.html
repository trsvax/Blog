<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
I'm about to do some major upgrades to my wife's website <a href="http://judypaul.com">JudyPaul.com</a> 
and I've decided document them as well as open up some of the code. I could use some random blog software
but instead I decided to start out by creating a blog written with Tapestry 5.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
The first step is to create some requirements. The big picture is keep it simple and don't get bogged down.
Now that those are out of the way here are the more technical ones.

<dl>
<dt>Use Amazon S3 to store the data.</dt>
<dd>The data store requirements will be simple and S3 is zero maintenance</dd>
<dt>Use Tynamo Security</dt>
<dd>While it's way more than I need it's way faster than writing something.</dd>
<dt>Use HTML for markup</dt>
<dd>No work and I know HTML.</dd>
<dt>Use Twitter Bootstrap Template</dt>
<dd>This is an experiment. The templates look nice and appear to be easy to use.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>Site Layout</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Index</li>
	<li>About</li>
	<li>Contact</li>
	<li>Admin</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Blog</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Blog Index</li>
	<li>Blog Edit</li>
	</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<h4>S3 Data Store</h4>
<p>
I've been using S3 for a number of years and when they release a Java SDK I created a set of Tapestry Services 
for many of the AWS products. 
It's a good example of how easy it is to create services from a library. The code is on
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/tapestry-aws-core">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
The 
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/Blog/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/interfaces/entities/Blog.java">entity</a> 
and <a hre="https://github.com/trsvax/Blog/blob/master/src/main/java/com/trsvax/services/AWSImpl/BlogDAOAWS.java">dao</a> 
are pretty simple. I've used an interface for the entity so it's easier to swap data stores when needed. I thought about
just serializing the entity into S3 but decided to use the S3 metadata to store the small fields. 
This makes it easier to change the entity in the future. The dao caches all the blogs and invalidates the cache on a save.
I don't expect to be updating that often and caching in ram should be OK for now.
</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
I always use <a href="http://tynamo.org/tapestry-security+guide">Tynamo Security</a> now. It's simple enough for simple cases
but can also handle complex ones. For this site I want one user and I want to protect the admin urls. Here is the 30 second guide:
<ol>
<li>List the directories you want to protect.
<pre>
<code>
public static void contributeSecurityConfiguration(Configuration<SecurityFilterChain> configuration,
           SecurityFilterChainFactory factory) {
   	configuration.add(factory.createChain("/admin/**").add(factory.roles(), "admin").build());
}
</code>
</pre>
</li>
<li>Specify the location of the users property file.
<pre>
<code>
public static void contributeWebSecurityManager(Configuration<Realm> configuration) {
    ExtendedPropertiesRealm realm = new ExtendedPropertiesRealm(System.getenv("HOME") + "/.shiro/blog.ini);
    configuration.add(realm);
}
</code>
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
That's it. If you want to know more I suggest reading the guide on the Tynamo site.
</p>
<h4>Layout Template</h4>
<p>
I just used one of the examples from <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to create the
<a href="https://github.com/trsvax/Blog/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/trsvax/components/Layout.tml">layout</a>. So 
far I'm pretty happy with the result. The grid systems seems pretty handy for putting something together quickly.
Someday I'll make the login form work with Tynamo.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I spent about 8 hours thinking about the project, writing the code and documenting it. Unfortunately a big piece of that was tracking down a Maven
build problem. The AWS JDK uses wildcards to match library versions and for some reason it wanted to use a 
broken snapshot version of commons-logging. After much searching I finally discovered this.
<pre>
<code>
&lt;exclusion&gt;
     		&lt;groupId&gt;commons-logging&lt;/groupId&gt;
     		&lt;artifactId&gt;commons-logging&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/exclusion&gt;
</code>
</pre>
I also wasted some time thinking about using something other than Tynamo for security. Note to self: Just use Tynamo!
</p>
<p>
So the app is pretty simple but it gets the job done. I suspect I'll add a few things along the way but the next project
is going to be an ecommerce site.
